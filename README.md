# Practice
## small practice scripts doing all kinds of random things


*sp500.py* downloads and visualizes S&P 500 data

*rw_practice.py* generates a random walk using a line plot theoretically could simulate molecular motion

*rand_walk_visual.py* produces gradient random walk displays using a scatter plow with the start/end points in green/red 
    *random_walk.py* is a module that builds the random walk that *rand_walk_visual.py* displays
